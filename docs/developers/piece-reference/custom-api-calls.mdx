Custom API Calls allow the user to send a request to a specific endpoint if no action has been implemented for it. 

This will show in the actions list of the piece as `Custom API Call`, to enable this action for a piece, you need to call the `createCustomApiCallAction` in your actions array.

## Example

The example below implements the action for the OpenAI piece. The OpenAI piece uses a `Bearer token` authorization header to identify the user sending the request.

```typescript
actions: [
    ...yourActions,
    createCustomApiCallAction({
        // The auth object defined in the piece
        auth: openaiAuth,
        // The base URL for the API
        baseUrl: 'https://api.openai.com/v1',
        // Mapping the auth object to the needed authorization headers
        authMapping: (auth: PieceAuthProperty) => {
            return {
                'Authorization': `Bearer ${auth}`
            }
        }
    })
]
```
