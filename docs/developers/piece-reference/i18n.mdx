<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate The Translation File">
     After adding the piece to the [AP_DEV_PIECES](/developers/development-setup/local) and running 
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
     Wait until you see this in your terminal: `Translation file for piece created in <piece_folder>/src/i18n/translation.json` that's where the translation file will be located
  </Step>
  <Step title="Translate to a Certain Locale">
    Once a change to a translation file is merged you can join our Crowdin project https://crowdin.com/project/activepieces and translate the piece there
  </Step>
  
   <Step title="Testing Locally">
    In your dashboard go to Project Settings -> Appearance -> Languages
    ![Languages](/resources/i18n-pieces.png)
   
    You can create or edit the locale file (it's a copy of the translation file with its values translated) i.e fr.json under the piece directory and see the change in the UI after refreshing.
  

     Then check the piece in the builder:
