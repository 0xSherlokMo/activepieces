### Let's scale pieces ðŸš€

By following these steps, you can use the scale-pieces CLI to generate piece: authentication, actions
using AI to automate the whole process using just an `openAPI` spec in both fromats **JSON** and **YAML**.

1. **Clone the Repository:**

Begin by creating a clone of the repository.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:activepieces/activepieces.git
```

2. **Use the CLI**

You can use either local json-server or a static JSON file stored in the activepieces directory

**I**. From an endpoint **(GET)**

If you don't know how to setup local json-server see [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server)

```bash
cd activepieces
npm run cli pieces scale http://localhost:3000/openAPI.json
```

**II**. From a static file in your repo

```bash
npm run cli pieces scale openAPIs/trello.json
```

> The last command expect that youre storing openAPIs/trello.json in the root directory of activepieces repo.
