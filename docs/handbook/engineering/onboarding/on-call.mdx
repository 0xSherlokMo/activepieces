The on-call rotation is a simple strategy to ensure there is always someone available to fix the issue for the users, each engineer is responsible for a week and the rotation is done by the team.

## Prerequisites:
- [Setup Incident IO](../playbooks/setup-incident-io)

## Why On-Call?

We need to ensure there is **exactly one person** at the same time who is the main point of contact for the users and the **first responder** for the issues. It's also a great way to learn about the product and the users and have some fun.

<Tip>
  You can listen to [Queen - Under Pressure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a01QQZyl-_I) while on-call, it's fun and motivating.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  If you ever feel burn out in middle of your rotation, please reach out to the team and we will help you with the rotation or take over the responsibility.

## What it means to be on-call

The primary objective of being on-call is to triage issues and assist users. It is not about fixing the issues or coding missing features. Delegation is key whenever possible.

You are responsible for the following:

* Respond to Slack messages as soon as possible, referring to the [customer support guidelines](./customer-support.mdx).

* Check [community.activepieces.com](https://community.activepieces.com) for any new issues or to learn about existing issues.

*  Respond once the pager run.

<Tip>
  **Friendly Tip #1**: always escalate to the team if you are unsure what to do.
</Tip>

## How do you get paged?

 Monitor and respond to incidents that come through these channels:

#### Slack Fire Emoji (ðŸ”¥)
When a customer reports an issue in Slack and someone reacts with ðŸ”¥, you'll be automatically paged and a dedicated incident channel will be created.
  
#### Automated Alerts
Watch for notifications from:
  - Digital Ocean about CPU, Memory, or Disk outages 
  - Checkly about e2e test failures or website downtime
