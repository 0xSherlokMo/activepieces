Incident.io is our primary tool for managing and responding to urgent issues and service disruptions. This guide explains how we use incident.io to coordinate our on-call rotations and emergency response procedures.

## Setup and Notifications

### Personal Setup
1. Download the incident.io mobile app from your device's app store
2. Ask your team to add you to the incident.io workspace
3. Configure your notification preferences:
   - Phone calls for critical incidents
   - Push notifications for high-priority issues
   - Slack notifications for standard updates

### On-Call Rotations
Our team operates on a weekly rotation schedule through incident.io, where every team member participates. When you're on-call:
- You'll receive priority notifications for all urgent issues
- Phone calls will be placed for critical service disruptions
- Rotations change every week, with handoffs occurring on Monday mornings
- Response is expected within 15 minutes for critical incidents


<Tip>
  If you are unable to respond to an incident, please escalate to the engineering team.

## Creating an Incident

There are three ways to create an incident:

### Channel 1: Fire Emoji Reaction through Slack

1. When a customer reports an issue in Slack
2. React to the message with the ðŸ”¥ emoji
3. This will automatically:
   - Create a new incident
   - Page the on-call engineer
   - Create a dedicated incident channel
   - Link the original message for context

### Channel 2: GitHub Issue

1. Create a new issue in the GitHub repository
2. Add the `high priority` label
3. This for immediate attention from the on-call engineer

### Channel 3: Outage Notification through Digital Ocean / Checkly

1. Digital Ocean will automatically notify us when there is an outage in CPU, Memory or Disk 
2. Checkly will automatically notify us when the e2e test fails and the website is down


## Best Practices
- Always acknowledge incident notifications
- Update the incident status regularly
- Document any actions taken in the incident channel
