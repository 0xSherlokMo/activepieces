You can use the embedded SDK to create connections.

## Step 1: Initialize the SDK

Follow the instructions in the [Initialize SDK](../configuration/initialize-embed) page

## Step 2: Call Connect method
After initializing the SDK you will have access to a property called `activepieces` inside your `window` object.
Call the connect method to open a new connection dialog as follows 
```html
<script> 
activepieces.connect({pieceName:'@activepieces/piece-google-sheets'});
</script>
```
