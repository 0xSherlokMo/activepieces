You can use the embedded SDK to create connections.

## Step 2: Call Connect method
After initializing the SDK you will have access to a property called `activepieces` inside your `window` object,
call the its `connect` method to open a new connection dialog as follows.

```html
<script> 
activepieces.connect({pieceName:'@activepieces/piece-google-sheets'});
</script>
```

**Connect Parameters:**

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| pieceName | ✅ | string | The name of the piece you want to create a connection for.
