This section provides an overview of how to embed the Activepieces builder in your application and automatically provision the user.

The embedding process involves the following steps:

<Steps>
    <Step title="Provision Users" >
        Generate a JSON Web Token (JWT) to identify your customer and pass it to the frontend, read more [here](./provision-users).
    </Step>
    <Step title="Embed Builder">
        Use our embedding SDK and the JWT token generated to embed Activepieces in your SaaS, and customize using the SDK, read more [here](./embed-builder).
    </Step>
</Steps>



<Tip>
In case, you need to gather connections in custom place in your application. You can do this with the SDK. Find more info [here](./embed-connections).
