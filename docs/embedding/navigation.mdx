## Default Navigation 

By default, our embedding sdk keeps the routes in the web app using it in sync with the routes of Activepieces, for example if your web app runs at:
`https://your-app.com/automations` and the `prefix` you pass in the [configure method](/embedding/embed-builder#configure-sdk) is `/automations` then when you navigate in Activepieces to `/flows` the url in the browser will be
`https://your-app.com/automations/flows`. 


## Custom Navigation

If you pass the navigation handler callback in the [configure method](/embedding/embed-builder#configure-sdk), the callback will be called every time a navigation happens within Activepieces, giving you complete control over it.



## Navigate Method

If you use `activepieces.navigate({ route: '/flows' })` this will tell the embedded sdk where to navigate to.

Here is the list for routes the sdk can navigate to:

| Route | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `/flows` | Flows table
| `/flows/{flowId}` | Opens up a flow in the builder
| `/runs` | Runs table
| `/runs/{runId}` | Opens up a run in the builder
| `/connections` | Connections table
